# Argo Rollouts - Kubernetes Progressive Delivery Controller
## What is Argo Rollouts ?
Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as Blue-Green, Canary, Canary analysis, Experimentation, and Progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.

Argo Rollouts (optionally) integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes, leveraging their traffic shaping abilities to gradually shift traffic to the new version during an update. Additionally, Rollouts can query and interpret metrics from various providers to verify key KPIs and drive automated promotion or rollback during an update.

This guide will demonstrate various concepts and features of Argo Rollouts by going through deployment, upgrade, promotion, and abortion of a Rollout.

## Why Argo Rollouts ?
Kubernetes Deployments provides the RollingUpdate strategy which provide a basic set of safety guarantees (readiness probes) during an update. However the rolling update strategy faces many limitations:

   *  	Few controls over the speed of the rollout
   *  	Inability to control traffic flow to the new version
   *  	Readiness probes are unsuitable for deeper, stress, or one-time checks
   *	No ability to query external metrics to verify an update
   *	Can halt the progression, but unable to automatically abort and rollback the update

For these reasons, in large scale high-volume production environments, a rolling update is often considered too risky of an update procedure since it provides no control over the blast radius, may rollout too aggressively, and provides no automated rollback upon failures.
Features

   *  	Blue-Green update strategy
   *  	Canary update strategy
   *  	Fine-grained, weighted traffic shifting
   *  	Automated rollbacks and promotions
   *  	Manual judgement
   *  	Customizable metric queries and analysis of business KPIs
   *  	Ingress controller integration: NGINX, ALB
   *  	Service Mesh integration: Istio, Linkerd, SMI
   *  	Metric provider integration: Prometheus, Wavefront, Kayenta, Web, Kubernetes Jobs

## Concepts
### Rollout
A Rollout is Kubernetes workload resource which is equivalent to a Kubernetes Deployment object. It is intended to replace a Deployment object in scenarios when more advanced deployment or progressive delivery functionality is needed. A Rollout provides the following features which a Kubernetes Deployment cannot:

* blue-green deployments
* canary deployments
* integration with ingress controllers and service meshes for advanced traffic routing
* integration with metric providers for blue-green & canary analysis
* automated promotion or rollback based on successful or failed metrics

#### Progressive Delivery

Progressive delivery is the process of releasing updates of a product in a controlled and gradual manner, thereby reducing the risk of the release, typically coupling automation and metric analysis to drive the automated promotion or rollback of the update.

Progressive delivery is often described as an evolution of continuous delivery, extending the speed benefits made in CI/CD to the deployment process. This is accomplished by limiting the exposure of the new version to a subset of users, observing and analyzing for correct behavior, then progressively increasing the exposure to a broader and wider audience while continuously verifying correctness.

#### Deployment Strategies

While the industry has used a consistent terminology to describe various deployment strategies, the implementations of these strategies tend to differ across tooling. To make it clear how the Argo Rollouts will behave, here are the descriptions of the various deployment strategies implementations offered by the Argo Rollouts.
Rolling Update

A RollingUpdate slowly replaces the old version with the new version. As the new version comes up, the old version is scaled down in order to maintain the overall count of the application. This is the default strategy of the Deployment object.
Recreate

A Recreate deployment deletes the old version of the application before bring up the new version. As a result, this ensures that two versions of the application never run at the same time, but there is downtime during the deployment.

#### Blue-Green

A Blue-Green deployment (sometimes referred to as a Red-Black) has both the new and old version of the application deployed at the same time. During this time, only the old version of the application will receive production traffic. This allows the developers to run tests against the new version before switching the live traffic to the new version.

#### Canary

A Canary deployment exposes a subset of users to the new version of the application while serving the rest of the traffic to the old version. Once the new version is verified to be correct, the new version can gradually replace the old version. Ingress controllers and service meshes such as NGINX and Istio, enable more sophisticated traffic shaping patterns for canarying than what is natively available (e.g. achieving very fine-grained traffic splitting, or splitting based on HTTP headers).

### 1. Deploying a Rollout
---------------------
First we deploy a Rollout resource and a Kubernetes Service targeting that Rollout. The example Rollout in this guide utilizes a canary update strategy which sends 20% of traffic to the canary, followed by a manual promotion, and finally gradual automated traffic increases for the remainder of the upgrade. This behavior is described in the following portion of the Rollout spec:
```
spec:
  replicas: 5
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
      - setWeight: 20
      - pause: {}
      - setWeight: 40
      - pause: {duration: 10}
      - setWeight: 60
      - pause: {duration: 10}
      - setWeight: 80
      - pause: {duration: 10}
```      

Run the following command to deploy the initial Rollout and Service:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl apply -f rollout.yaml
rollout.argoproj.io/rollouts-demo created
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl apply -f service.yaml
service/rollouts-demo created
```
Initial creations of any Rollout will immediately scale up the replicas to 100% (skipping any canary upgrade steps, analysis, etc...) since there was no upgrade that occurred.

The Argo Rollouts kubectl plugin allows you to visualize the Rollout, its related resources (ReplicaSets, Pods, AnalysisRuns), and presents live state changes as they occur. To watch the rollout as it deploys, run the get rollout --watch command from plugin:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch

### 2. Updating a Rollout
---------------------
Next it is time to perform an update. Just as with Deployments, any change to the Pod template field (spec.template) results in a new version (i.e. ReplicaSet) to be deployed. Updating a Rollout involves modifying the rollout spec, typically changing the container image field with a new version, and then running kubectl apply against the new manifest. As a convenience, the rollouts plugin provides a set image command, which performs these steps against the live rollout object in-place. Run the following command to update the rollouts-demo Rollout with the "yellow" version of the container:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow
rollout "rollouts-demo" image updated
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$

```
When the demo rollout reaches the second step, we can see from the plugin that the Rollout is in a paused state, and now has 1 of 5 replicas running the new version of the pod template, and 4 of 5 replicas running the old version. This equates to the 20% canary weight as defined by the setWeight: 20 step

### 3. Promoting a Rollout
---------------------
The rollout is now in a paused state. When a Rollout reaches a pause step with no duration, it will remain in a paused state indefinitely until it is resumed/promoted. To manually promote a rollout to the next step, run the promote command of the plugin:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts promote rollouts-demo
rollout 'rollouts-demo' promoted
```

After promotion, Rollout will proceed to execute the remaining steps. The remaining rollout steps in our example are fully automated, so the Rollout will eventually complete steps until it has has fully transitioned to the new version. Watch the rollout again until it has completed all steps:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch

```

-	Note : The promote command also supports the ability to skip all remaining steps and analysis with the --full flag.

Once all steps complete successfully, the new ReplicaSet is marked as the "stable" ReplicaSet. Whenever a rollout is aborted during an update, either automatically via a failed canary analysis, or manually by a user, the Rollout will fall back to the "stable" version.


### 4. Aborting a Rollout
---------------------

Next we will learn how to manually abort a rollout during an update. First, deploy a new "red" version of the container using the set image command, and wait for the rollout to reach the paused step again:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:red
rollout "rollouts-demo" image updated

[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts abort rollouts-demo

[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch

```
   
This time, instead of promoting the rollout to the next step, we will abort the update, so that it falls back to the "stable" version. The plugin provides an abort command as a way to manually abort a rollout at any time during an update:

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$ kubectl argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch

In order to make Rollout considered Healthy again and not Degraded, it is necessary to change the desired state back to the previous, stable version. This typically involves running kubectl apply against the previous Rollout spec. In our case, we can simply re-run the set image command using the previous, "yellow" image

```
[user@kub-app001 kubernetes]$  kubectl argo rollouts set image rollouts-demo  rollouts-demo=argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow

```
When a Rollout has not yet reached its desired state (e.g. it was aborted, or in the middle of an update), and the stable manifest were re-applied, the Rollout detects this as a rollback and not a update, and will fast-track the deployment of the stable ReplicaSet by skipping analysis, and the steps.


### Summary

In this guide, we have learned basic capabilities of Argo Rollouts, including:
* Deploying a rollout
* Performing a canary update
* Manual promotion
* Manual abortion

The Rollout in this basic example did not utilize a ingress controller or service mesh provider to route traffic. Instead, it used normal Kubernetes Service networking (i.e. kube-proxy) to achieve an approximate canary weight, based on the closest ratio of new to old replica counts. As a result, this Rollout had a limitation in that it could only achieve a minimum canary weight of 20%, by scaling 1 of 5 pods to run the new version. In order to achieve much finer grained canaries, an ingress controller or service mesh is necessary.
